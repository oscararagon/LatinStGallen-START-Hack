# Hackathon Project - Fight Wildfire

This repository contains our team's work on developing a visualization tool to summarize the gravity of land degradation issues in Brazil focusing on wildfires for the G20 Global Land Initiative Hackathon.

## Task1
Our work is divided in two stages:

### Stage 1: Baseline Model
In the initial phase, we built a baseline model. This model was able to achieve a Test Set Accuracy of ... after training for 15 epochs using the Adam optimizer. All baseline performances and model specifications can be found in the `baseline_model` directory in this repository.

### Stage 2: Enhanced Model
After obtaining results from the baseline model, we refined and fine-tuned our model in order to build an enhanced version. Details of the improvements and additional features that were included, as well as clarity on the results are documented in the `enhanced_model` directory.
